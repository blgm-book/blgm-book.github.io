This book is about Bayesian latent Gaussian models, which are a subclass within the class of Bayesian hierarchical models, and how they can be used to model and analyze data in geophysics and environmental sciences. The book is set up such that in the first chapter, Bayesian latent Gaussian models are introduced, and in the six subsequent chapters, case studies on modeling and analysis of geophysical of environmental data with these models are given.

The first chapter covers three subclasses of Bayesian latent Gaussian models, namely, Bayesian Gaussianâ€”Gaussian models, and Bayesian latent Gaussian models with either a univariate or a multivariate link function. The first chapter also covers the construction of prior densities for the model parameters, Bayesian inference methods for these parameters, and how to make predictions with these models. The case studies involve analysis of data from glaciology, hydrology, engineering seismology, weather, and climate. Code that relates to the case studies is made available on this wepage.
